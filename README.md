## **Setup Instructions**  

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suyashpurwar1/whatbytes.git
   cd whatbytes
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Due to compatibility issues between the current version of `react` and some dependencies(only recharts for graph components), you need to force install the packages:  
   ```bash
   npm install --force
   ```  
   > **Note**: The `--force` flag overrides peer dependency conflicts. Please monitor any warnings or errors during installation.
   > 
3. **Start the Project**  
   Launch the development server by running:  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```  
   The application will run at `http://localhost:3000`.
